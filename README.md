# LEACH Protocol Simulation

This repository contains the implementation of several variants of the LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). These algorithms focus on energy-efficient clustering to extend the network lifetime. The simulation is built using Python and includes four main LEACH variants:

1. **LEACH-Ori** - The original LEACH protocol.
2. **LEACH-KMeans** - LEACH with K-Means clustering for cluster head selection.
3. **LEACH-Centralized** - A centralized LEACH version where a base station assigns cluster heads based on specific criteria.
4. **LEACH-GA** - LEACH with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach for optimized cluster head selection.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leach-protocol-simulation.git
   cd leach-protocol-simulation

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
You can run the simulation for each LEACH variant separately. Customize parameters like the number of nodes, simulation rounds, and energy parameters to match your specific requirements.# leach
